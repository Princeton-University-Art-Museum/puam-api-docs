      "textentryhtml": "\r\nPastel was Edgar Degas’s preferred medium late in his career. Inexpensive, light, and flexible, it allowed for endless technical experimentation and offered the aging artist a degree of manual control that the paintbrush could not. Crucially, pastel also allowed him to work simultaneously as a draftsman and colorist and thereby collapse the traditional academic distinction between line and color.</P>\r\nThe subject of the ballet, which Degas had pioneered in the 1870s, dominated these late works. Compared to his earlier work on the theme, however, they have been stripped of any anecdotal interest, the focus no longer on behind-the-scenes specificities of dance production or its social context. Here, Degas has eliminated nearly all background information, restricting himself to the vaguest suggestion, as if filtered through the haze of memory, of a staggered series of cutout stage flats, a convenient pretext for an abstract array of colors and linear arabesques. He zooms in on his subject, concentrating on only three dancers and representing them at three-quarter length, lending them an almost ancient monumentality and gravity in the process. Rather than illustrate a specific dance or rehearsal, the poses and gestures of which might correlate to the codified lexicon of the ballet, Degas treats his dancers as elements in an abstract pictorial configuration, flattening and compressing them into a single entity whose pinwheel array of bent arms moves to some obscure, stately rhythm. In their somnolent attentiveness to their own bodies and psychological isolation from each other and the viewer, the dancers bear a&nbsp;striking resemblance to his late bathers. </P>\r\nSuch echoes between subjects are not surprising given that Degas’s late work was overwhelmingly a private studio affair. His art became increasingly self-referential and introspective, as he traced, recycled, and altered his favorite motifs from drawing to drawing, allowing him to experiment with different compositional arrangements and color schemes. Typical of the artist’s late graphic techniques, <I>Dancers</I> began as a monochromatic charcoal drawing that he built up with as many as four or five interpenetrating layers of pastel. He applied the pastel both wet and dry, probably using fixative and steam intermittently to keep the colors pure and distinct. Evocative of the shimmering heat and artificial lighting of the theater, these highly saturated, synthetic colors were intensified through complementary, hot-and-cold contrasts, most notably between coral reds and aqua greens and between oranges and royal and powder blues. Applied in insistently vertical and diagonal striations, Degas’s pastel strokes work both to model forms and to erode the boundaries between dancers, costumes, and surrounds, so that the image appears to dissolve slowly even as it gains in material substance. Enhancing this corrosive effect, Degas also burnished areas of the pastel, forcing the medium into the interstices of the support, producing tiny pits and craters in the process. <I>Dancers</I> is both viscerally tactile and optical in its appeal, as Degas exploits to maximum effect the coarse, friable qualities of the medium, presenting a richly textured, densely fractured and accretive surface, one that appears to be the product of remote, ineluctable forces that are more geological or chemical than human. </P></SPAN>",

      "textentryhtml": "<p>\n\tDegas’s <i>Dancers</i> depicts a gathering of people in motion, but not in performance. I am most intrigued by the faces and hands. One dancer adjusts her hair and clothing, while the others move about hurriedly—backstage happenings that many dancers know well. However universal such a moment may be, I wonder about the who, what, and where not represented here. Current conversations in the fields of dance and Black feminist studies offer exciting opportunities to engage with and build context around this drawing. While we admire Degas’s figures, we can also use scholar Marisa J. Fuentes’s method of “reading along the bias grain” to consider what concurrent nineteenth-century dance identities, traditions, and forms are omitted or hidden from view. For example, <i>Dancers</i> was completed around the time George Washington Smith (ca. 1820–1899) died. Smith was a mixed-race performer and teacher from Philadelphia, and the first prominent American male ballet master.\n</p>\n<p><b>\n\tMichael J. Love</b>, Interdisciplinary Tap Dance Artist\n</p>",

The tombstone response offers a much simplified subset of the full object record, suitable for situations in which only the basic data needed to identify the object is required.

## Get multiple objects

`GET /objects?[param]=[value]`

In order to facilitate the retrieval of multiple objects, select fields have been exposed as parameters. A multi-object response consists of all object records that match the selected criteria.

Available parameters are:

- maker (ID)
- department (Exact Name)
- term (ID)

#### Example

> https://data.artmuseum.princeton.edu/objects?maker=6353

Additional query parameters can be appended to any multi-record request to control filtering, sorting, and pagination of results. The available query parameters are:

`size` - establishes the maximum number of records to be retrieved at once (integer, defaults to 10, up to a maximum of 500).  
`from` - offset position of the first result to be retrieved which can effectively be used to paginate through large result sets via multiple repeated requests (integer, defaults to 0)  
`sort` - field on which to sort results (field name, defaults to Lucene query score)  
`sortorder` - order in which to sort results ('ASC' or 'DESC', defaults to DESC)
